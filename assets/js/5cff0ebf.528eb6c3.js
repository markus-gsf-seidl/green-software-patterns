State includes the data structures and member variables that the service reads and writes. Depending on how the service is architected, the state might also include files or other resources stored on the disk. Applications that consume large memory or on-disk data require larger VM sizes, especially for cloud computing where you would need larger VM SKUs to support high RAM capacity and multiple data disks.","permalink":"/catalog/cloud/implement-stateless-design"},{"id":"catalog/cloud/match-utilization-requirements-of-vm","title":"Match utilization requirements of virtual machines (VMs)","description":"It\'s better to have one VM running at a higher utilization than two running at low utilization rates, not only in terms of energy proportionality but also in terms of embodied carbon.

Adding more resources to support increased traffic requirements introduces more embodied carbon and more demand for electricity. Continuing to handle all requests during high carbon intensity will increase overall emissions for your system. Shedding traffic that is lower priority during these scenarios will save on resources and carbon emissions. This approach requires an understanding of your traffic, including which call requests are critical and which can best withstand retry attempts and failures.","permalink":"/catalog/cloud/shed-lower-priority-traffic"},{"id":"catalog/cloud/evaluate-whether-to-use-TLS-termination","title":"Terminate TLS at border gateway","description":"Transport Layer Security (TLS) ensures that all data passed between the web server and web browsers remain private and encrypted.
