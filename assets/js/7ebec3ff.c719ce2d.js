Adding more resources to support increased traffic requirements introduces more embodied carbon and more demand for electricity. Continuing to handle all requests during high carbon intensity will increase overall emissions for your system. Shedding traffic that is lower priority during these scenarios will save on resources and carbon emissions. This approach requires an understanding of your traffic, including which call requests are critical and which can best withstand retry attempts and failures.","permalink":"/catalog/cloud/shed-lower-priority-traffic"},{"id":"catalog/cloud/time-shift-kubernetes-cron-jobs","title":"Time-shift Kubernetes cron jobs","description":"The carbon emissions of a software system depends on the power consumed by that software, but also on the Carbon intensity of the electricity it is powered on.
